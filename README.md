 No idea what this is gonna be

## Ideas?
- **Spotify API** application to create radio
  - User enters one song that is used to find similar songs and artists
  - Create queue and Spotify music player
  - User can up/down vote a song and the queue adjusts

  - For **front-end**: 
    - Show album art and other song info
    - Display song quote 
    - Other view shows visual representation of song selection algorithm

- **Reelgood API** to find similar movies to input
  - Show streaming options for suggestions
  - Show metadata (e.g. ratings, release, cast, etc.)
  - Display movie poster & trailer

- **NASA API** or some other planetary tracking api could be cool 
  - Maybe doing a simulation type application that shows the stars relative to the user's location
