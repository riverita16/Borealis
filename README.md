# El Team Dream COP3530 Project 3
Alanis Rivera-Narvaez, Jorge Ramirez, David Denis

It can be hard to find songs that are similar to one specific track, rather than a broad category, artist, or genre. Spotifyâ€™s songs recommendations are sometimes unrelated, unreliable, out of place, and simply off. It is also time consuming to manually search for your next song. So users need a reliable, fast, and easier way to find new songs they like based on their preferences. A simple UI makes for minimal user interaction required but maximal satisfaction with the results.

## Borealis
- **Spotify API** application to find and listen to an infinite number of songs that are similar to just one -- personalized radio.
  - User enters one song and that is used to find similar tracks and artists
  - Create queue and Spotify music player
  - Sort the queue based on the user's audio characteristic and sorting algortihm selection
  - **Python** backend

  - For **front-end**: 
    - Show album art
    - Display song info 
    - **React JS** and **Flask** for frontend

**Note:** The program expects a song. If a different form of media is inputted, Borealis will find a song that most closely matches the entered name.

## Algorithms
- Mergesort
- Smoothsort

## Workflow
- [x] Flask interacts with React code
- [x] Front end for home page
- [x] Add characteristic and search algorithm drop downs
      - [x] Send values on submit
- [x] Spotify player renders
- [x] Queue play works
- [x] When song ends go to next song (no back function)
  - [ ] Fix multiple requests to /next at song end
- [x] Add to liked songs functionality (EDIT: Embedded player already has this functionality)
- [ ] Validate only tracks are inputted (catch fails to /track endpoint)

- [ ] Sort queue
    - [x] Mergesort
    - [ ] Smoothsort
    - [ ] Allow each by a song characteristic

- [ ] Make new logo for tab
